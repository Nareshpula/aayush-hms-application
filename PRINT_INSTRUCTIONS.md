The headers (date/time and page title) and footers (URL and page numbers) you see are **browser-generated** and cannot be removed with CSS alone.

#### For Chrome / Edge / Brave:
1. Click the Print button
2. In the Print dialog, click **"More settings"**
3. Uncheck **"Headers and footers"**
4. The date, page title, and URL will now be hidden
5. Print or Save as PDF

#### For Firefox:
1. Click the Print button
2. In the Print dialog, click **"Page Setup"** or open **Print Settings**
3. Go to **"Margins & Header/Footer"** tab
4. Set all headers and footers to **"--blank--"**
5. Print or Save as PDF

#### For Safari:
1. Click the Print button
2. Click **"Show Details"** (bottom left)
3. Uncheck **"Print headers and footers"**
4. Print or Save as PDF

## Expected Clean Output

Once headers and footers are disabled, you should see:
- **No date/time** at the top left
- **No page title** at the top center/right
- **No URL** at the bottom left
- **No page numbers** at the bottom right
- Only the hospital bill content with proper logo and formatting

## Print Settings Recommendations

- **Paper size**: A4
- **Margins**: Set by CSS (12mm all sides)
- **Headers and footers**: OFF
- **Background graphics**: ON (to show tables and borders)
